# Kiwi - Unofficial client for ChatGPT
Unofficial client for ChatGPT written in Tkinter<br>
Written in: Python with os, openai, json, tkinter and threading libraries<br><br>
Pros:
 - Lightweight. Thanks to Python and Tkinter, Kiwi can even run in the microwave!
 - Open source. Modify what you want and how you want.
 - Export chats as TXT (logs) and JSON
 - Two versions: console and GUI

Cons:
 - No formatting

Requirements:
 - Python >=3.7.1
 - [OpenAI library](https://pypi.org/project/openai/) *(can be installed with pip)*
 - Tkinter library (built into Python)
 - OpenAI account with a [free trial balance or a pre-loaded balance](https://platform.openai.com/account/usage) and an [active API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).
 - Active internet connection

But I will try to correct the cons over time (except for the second and third) and the program will become much better!
If you're interested, look forward to the **first release**!
