# Kiwi - Unofficial client for ChatGPT
Unofficial client for ChatGPT written in Tkinter
Written in: Python with os, openai, json, tkinter, locale, threading, platform and libraries
Pros:
 - Lightweight. Thanks to Python and Tkinter, Kiwi can even run in the microwave!
 - Open source. Modify what you want and how you want.

Cons:
 - No formatting
 - No wrap to next line
 - No chat saves
 - Waiting 10 seconds under heavy load
 - Requires an API key from OpenAI

But I will try to correct the cons over time (except for the fourth and fifth) and the program will become much better!
