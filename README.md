# Kiwi - Unofficial client for ChatGPT
Unofficial client for ChatGPT written in Tkinter
Written in: Python with os, openai, json, tkinter, locale, threading, platform and libraries
Pros:
 - Lightweight. Thanks to Python and Tkinter, Kiwi can even run in the microwave!
 - Open source. Modify what you want and how you want.
 - Export chats as TXT (logs) and JSON
 - Two versions: console and GUI

Cons:
 - No formatting
 - Waiting 10 seconds under heavy load
 - Requires an API key from OpenAI

Requirements:
 - Python >=3.7.1
 - OpenAI library *(can be installed with pip)*
 - OpenAI account with a free trial balance or a pre-loaded balance and an active API key.
 - Active internet connection

But I will try to correct the cons over time (except for the second and third) and the program will become much better!
If you're interested, look forward to the **first release**!
